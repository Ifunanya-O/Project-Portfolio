Created a Dashboard using Power BI to show the January IT Spend as compared to the Budget & Forecast, and also the Breakdown of Data Professionals Survey.
• I	Used Power Query to combine, clean and transform data to ensure data validity and reliability.
•	Then used DAX function to create new measures for data completeness, and used Drill Down and Conditional formatting to create visualizations quicker understanding.	
•	This is the link to the Dashboard Presentation. (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1T4vQRLlYATRKj1AH72nfi8DphYeR9d1h?usp=share_link).
