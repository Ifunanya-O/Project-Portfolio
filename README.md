The Titanic project was done as part of the Kaggle Titanic Data Project. Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Cleaning were done using Pandas. Python functions were defined to manipulate data. Data Visualizations were then done using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
The other python project was to practise scrapping data from a website using BeautifulSoup library in Python. The data extracted was converted to a DataFrame using the Pandas library for easier anlysis.
